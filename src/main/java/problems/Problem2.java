 * Problem2 implements IProblem interface.
 * It can have any number of fields as required, and a constructor that sets those fields
 * It should return a Boolean object as result.
 *
 * 1. Resolve any existing compilation errors.
 *
 * 2. Implement solve() method according to the following description:
 * Given a String that only consists of characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', find out if the string is valid.
 * String is valid, if every open bracket is closed with the same type of bracket. e.g. "()"
 * Brackets must be closed in correct order. e.g. "([])" is valid. but "[(])" is not valid.
 *
 * 3. Complete the test cases that are specified in TestProblem2 test class.
